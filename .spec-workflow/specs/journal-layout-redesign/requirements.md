# Journal Page Layout Redesign Requirements

## 1. Overview

The goal of this redesign is to improve the layout of the Daily Journal page for better visual organization and more efficient use of space.

## 2. Key Changes

Based on the provided design mockup, the following changes are required:

### 2.1. Top Content Alignment

- **Requirement:** The 'Journal Entries' component and the 'Session Overview' sidebar component must be vertically aligned to the top of their container.
- **Rationale:** This creates a cleaner, more organized look at the top of the page.

### 2.2. Main Content Area Resizing

- **Requirement:** The main journal entry area (containing 'Daily Notes' and 'Emotional State Tracking') should be made significantly wider.
- **Details:** The width of the 'Session Overview' sidebar may need to be reduced to accommodate this change while maintaining a visually appealing layout.
- **Rationale:** To provide more horizontal space for writing notes and interacting with journal components.

### 2.3. Horizontal Mood Selection UI

- **Requirement:** The 'Overall Mood' selection components, which are currently displayed in a vertical list, must be redesigned to display horizontally in a single row.
- **Details:** This applies to all instances of the mood selector on the page (e.g., Pre-Market, Post-Market).
- **Rationale:** To significantly reduce vertical scrolling and make the emotional state tracking section more compact and user-friendly.
